## About the Project
### Introduction
This repository includes the solutions that were developed for the **Microprocessors I Laboratory** course of my university. The folders named **Lab2a**, **Lab2b**, **Lab3a**, **Lab4a**, **Lab4b**, **Lab6a**, **Lab7a** and **Lab8a** have my developed solutions for each of the assignments given throughout the laboratory course, and those with the names **Review_1_Instructions**, **Review_2_Tables** and **Review_2_Tables** have the example solutions provided by the professor of the course.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
These files were written in the **ARM Assembly Language** with the **Keil uVision 5 Embedded Development Tool**. The website of the company that develops such tool is found [here](https://www.keil.com/). It should be noted that _Keil uVision 5_ was configured to work with the **TM4C123GH6PM** device.

### Installation
After **Keil uVision 5** is installed and configured, all that is left to do is to open the **.uvprojx** file with such software.

## Usage
With the _.uvprojx_ file in _Keil uVision 5_, all that is left to is to connect the computer to the _TM4C123GH6PM_ device via a USB cable, and compile and run the program from Keil itself. It should be noted that the ARM Assembly code that was developed was for a microprocessor of the ARM-32 Architecture. 

## Updates?
Need to verify my notes from 2021 to check if information needs to be added or changed.
